/**
 * SGP4 : Simplified General Perturbations 4 is by far the most common method for propagating satellite locations beyond
 * simple Kepler Element/Two-body propagation. The SGP4 reference implementation can be read about in the ancient paper
 * "SPACETRACK REPORT NO. 3," (STR3) found here https://celestrak.com/NORAD/documentation/spacetrk.pdf. This paper
 * includes all equations, both typeset as well as an implementation in FORTAN.
 *
 * A more recent implementation of this algorithm can be found accompanying the paper "Revisiting Space
 * Track Report #3," (RSTR3) found here: https://celestrak.com/publications/AIAA/2006-6753/.
 *
 * A few observations on the above:
 *
 * The publicly available RSTR3 code is not particularly well commented and has hard to read variable names and code blocks. This
 * is likely due to its resemblance to the original FORTRAN implementation, which also suffers from these problems. One
 * of the biggest challenges I have faced in working with SGP4 is knowing what equations came from what source or
 * formula in the original paper.
 *
 * Given the above, this implementation of SGP4 is based on the code from RSTR3, ported to Scala, but also makes an
 * attempt to reconcile all equations with equations from STR3 as well as the paper
 * "History of Analytical Orbit Modeling in the U.S. Space Surveillance System," by Felix R. Hoots, Paul W. Schumacher
 * Jr., and Robert A. Glover. A careful study of RSTR3 has been done and, where possible, equations and values have been
 * extracted and renamed to more fully match the equations found in STR3 and Hoots.
 *
 * Some difficulties have arisen, such as finding equations for updating lunar and solar gravity long periodic effects
 * since those equations are referenced in the 1961 edition of the
 * "Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris and the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac." The most
 * recent version of this text, "The Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac," was published in 2012 varies
 * greatly from the original and pagination and other updates have made a simple reference to the source equations
 * difficult. Note that when writing this I found this archive
 * "https://archive.org/stream/astronomicalalmanac1961/131221-explanatory-supplement-1961_djvu.txt" which might be
 * useful in locating original source equations.
 *
 * The ultimate goal of this implementation are:
 * 1. Compliance with existing versions.
 * 2. Readability - This is a work in progress, but the goal is the have all equations and constants match their
 * descriptions from the original works.
 * 3. Simplicity - This is an extremely simple API to use, having methods for construction, consumption, and analysis of
 * TLEs as well as a simple API for actual SGP4 propagation.
